Rhonda Duvall "Honey", is an independent R&B artist, with a mix of Hip Hop and Soul.
Her style of music tends to open one's eyes to a different perspective and gives the listener a chance to unwind in the simplicity of words and thought.

Some say, "She tells a message,"  

Others say, "She speaks of real life experiences,"  

Honey says, "I speak on how the world approaches me."
